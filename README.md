# 📊 Advanced Analytics Project – SQL Data Warehouse & BI Analysis

#🧠 Advanced Analytics Data Warehouse Project
This project sets up a SQL Server-based Data Warehouse for analytical reporting. It demonstrates the full cycle from database creation to data ingestion using BULK INSERT. The warehouse includes dimension and fact tables optimized for advanced data analytics tasks. 📊 Cumulative Sales Analytics – SQL Window Functions
This segment of the Advanced Analytics project demonstrates how to perform cumulative and moving average calculations over time using SQL Server window functions. These insights are essential for trend analysis and time-series reporting.

This repository contains a full-fledged **SQL-based Advanced Analytics Project**, simulating a data warehouse and performing deep-dive business analytics on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

Ideal for:
- Business intelligence analysts
- Data engineers & data analysts
- Students learning SQL-based analytics
- Portfolio enhancement for job applications

## 🧩 Data Warehouse Design

**Database:** `DataWarehouseAnalytics`  
**Schema:** `gold`  
**Tables:**
- `dim_customers`: Customer demographics and lifecycle
- `dim_products`: Product attributes and pricing
- `fact_sales`: Sales transactions (order facts)

✅ Star schema modeling  
✅ Normalized dimension tables  
✅ Fact table for analytics

## 📦 Datasets

| Table            | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `dim_customers`  | Contains customer profile info         |
| `dim_products`   | Details about products, categories     |
| `fact_sales`     | Sales transactions across time         |

Each dataset is stored in CSV format and ingested using `BULK INSERT`.

## 📊 Analytical Modules

### 📈 1. **Sales Trend Analysis**
- Monthly and yearly sales patterns
- Identify seasonality and performance shifts
- Cumulative revenue tracking
- Moving average pricing

### 📊 2. **Product Performance**
- Product-level sales vs average
- Year-over-year growth
- Performance segmentation (High/Mid/Low)
- Average Order Revenue & Monthly Revenue

### 👥 3. **Customer Segmentation**
- Segment customers by lifetime spend and order history:
  - VIP: > ₹5000 & lifespan ≥ 12 months  
  - Regular: ≤ ₹5000 & lifespan ≥ 12 months  
  - New: Lifespan < 12 months
- Track customer age groups
- KPIs: Average Order Value (AOV), Monthly Spend, Recency

### 🧠 4. **Category Contribution**
- Contribution to overall revenue by product category
- Percentage breakdown (Part-to-Whole analysis)

### 🧮 5. **Data Segmentation**
- Products grouped by cost into price segments:
  - Below ₹100
  - ₹100–₹500
  - ₹500–₹1000
  - Above ₹1000

---

## 📊 Reports

### ✅ Customer Report
Generated by SQL using CTEs and aggregations:
- Age & Age Group
- Customer segment (VIP, Regular, New)
- Total orders, sales, products bought
- Recency, AOV, monthly spend

### ✅ Product Report
Materialized as a **SQL View** `gold.report_products`:
- Product category & segment
- Sales stats: quantity, revenue, customers
- Recency of last sale
- KPI: Avg Order Revenue, Monthly Revenue

---

## 📋 Example KPIs Used

| Metric                | Description                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| AOV (Avg Order Value) | `Total Sales / Total Orders`             |
| Recency               | `Months since last order/sale`           |
| Monthly Spend         | `Total Sales / Lifespan in Months`       |
| Customer Lifespan     | `Months between first & last order`      |
| YOY Change            | `Current Year - Previous Year Sales`     |

---

## 💡 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
- **Window Functions** (`LAG`, `SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`)
- **CASE WHEN** for segmentation
- **Date & time functions** (`DATEDIFF`, `FORMAT`, `DATETRUNC`)
- **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- **Joins** and **subqueries**
- **Views** for report abstraction

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### Requirements:
- SQL Server (2016 or newer recommended)
- SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)
- CSV files placed in appropriate path on local system

### Steps:
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rasulajees/sql-data-analytics-project.git

Update the file paths in BULK INSERT statements (point to your actual CSV path):
FROM 'C:\Path\To\Your\gold.dim_customers.csv'

Open advanced_analytics_project.sql in SSMS and run step-by-step:

Creates database, schema, and tables

Inserts data

Runs all queries and creates views

⚠️ Caution: The script drops the database if it already exists.

📌 Future Enhancements
 Integrate Power BI or Tableau dashboards

 Automate ETL with SSIS / Python

 Add stored procedures for dynamic report generation

 Introduce data quality checks (e.g., NULL validation)

📚 Learning Outcomes
✅ End-to-end data warehousing simulation

✅ Business understanding of customer/product KPIs

✅ Real-world SQL analytical skills

✅ Reusable SQL templates for BI reporting

Let me know if you'd like help generating:
- A **Power BI dashboard** for these KPIs
- A **PDF report** summary of findings
- **ER diagram** for your schema

Or, I can help **convert this SQL logic to Python or Pandas** for Jupyter Notebook analysis.
